The findings on factors that affect the acceptance rate are as follows:
- 80 degree weather will result in a slightly higher acceptance rate than 30 or 50.
- For bar coupons, acceptance rate is positively correlated with how frequently the driver goes to a bar.
- About 70% of bar coupons are accepted by those who goes to bars more than once a month, regardless of other attributes.
- Coffee house coupon usage is positively correlated with how frequent the driver goes to a coffee house.
- For coffee house coupons, the acceptance rate for 1 day coupons is higher overall compared to 2 hour coupons.
- 2 hour coffee house coupons have the high acceptance rate in the morning around 10AM and very low acceptance rate in the evening.
- 24 hour coffee house coupons have high acceptance rate throughout the day.
- The duration of the coupon impacts those going to work the most as they are much more likely to accept the coupon if it was 24 hours vs 2 hours. But overall, acceptance rates for each destination went up with longer duration.
